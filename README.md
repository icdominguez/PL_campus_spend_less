# PL Coding February - March Challenge
This is the repository with the development I made for the PL Coding community. It's an app for tracking spending. Create income and expenses by storing everything locally. Change your settings as you want and don't lose anything.

## Unauthorized Stack

Create your user with your settings setting a PIN you'll need to remember

## Authorized Stack

Create income and expenses, provide details on the description and keep track of everything. The app will show your balance and the total amount you have in your account will be calculated. 

IMPORTANT: There is no server in this app so if you uninstall the app, you will loose everything.

Export your transactions for the last month, current month, last 3 months, or all transactions with the export button and see all your transactions with the show all button.
